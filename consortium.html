        <h2>TA-MOONS Science Consortium</h2>
        <strong>Purpose</strong>
        <hr>
        <p>The purpose of this Science Consortium is to optimize scientific outcomes and design the Young Stellar Object (YSO) survey, 
            along with addressing other major scientific objectives of the TA-MOONS project. </p>
        <br>


        <strong>Membership Criteria</strong>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Membership is open to anyone who possesses at least one specific science proposal utilizing TA-MOONS 
                and has the resources to complete the project promptly once data becomes available.</li>
                <li>We are a small, professional community committed to collegial interaction to produce the best scientific results.
                     All members are required to sign and adhere to the TA-MOONS Code of Ethics and the Honour System (Detailed below). </li>
        </ul>
        <br>


        <strong>Advantages of Joining the Consortium</strong>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Receive assistance and feedback from the instrument team to optimize your observations. </li>
            <li>Collaborate closely with the team to ensure that instrument designs align with your scientific objectives.</li>
            <li>Observations will be conducted via a dedicated project observer under a Queue system, eliminating the need for travel to DOT for observations.</li>
            <li>The instrument team will perform quality checks on the collected data. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>


        <strong>Joining Procedure</strong>
        <hr>
        <p>To optimize the survey, we require a clearly defined list of science projects rather than general areas of research. 
            Thus, the procedure to join the TA-MOONS Science Consortium involves the submission of a concise internal research proposal limited to a single page (or max two pages). 
            The Principal Investigator (PI) of the proposal will serve as the primary contact and will become an official member of the science consortium. 
            <br> Each proposal (maximum of two pages) must include the following components: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title of the Project.</li>
                <li>A paragraph of Science Justification.</li>
                <li>Target List (or a description of how the target list will be developed). </li>
                <li>A brief explanation of why TA-MOONS is the appropriate instrument for this research, highlighting critical instrument specifications.</li>
                <li>Timeline for publication of results, including a manpower plan. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To maintain transparency, all proposals within the science consortium will be accessible to all members. This is designed to prevent duplication of observations in the target list. 
                The PI of each proposal must also explicitly agree to the Honour System outlined below. </p>
                <br>
         
        <strong>Honour System</strong>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Members will have read-only access to all proposals within the consortium, which are proprietary to individual PIs. All members agree to maintain the confidentiality of these proposals.</li>
            <li>Members will have read-only access to all data collected by the science consortium, but must restrict usage of the data to their specific proposed science. If the same data is shared among multiple 
                proposal PIs, coordination is required during analysis and publication to avoid overlapping results. </li>
            <li>If changes to the project scope are necessary after the proposal’s submission, the following steps must be taken:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that any revised scope does not conflict with other consortium proposals. </li>
                <li>Obtain explicit permission from members who may be affected by the scope change. 
                    (Note: If two PIs propose identical research and choose not to collaborate, both proposals will be removed from the consortium, allowing them to pursue their observations independently).</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>If data is obtained through the science consortium, support will be provided by the instrument team to aid in data comprehension and reduction. 
            <br>Throughout the publication process, the following conditions must be met: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proper acknowledgment of funding agencies, citations, and observatories in any published text (a standard acknowledgment template will be provided).</li>
            <li>All instrument architects (as defined in Section IA) should be invited to contribute comments on the work. If they provide input, they should be offered co-authorship. The manuscript must be circulated 
                to all signed members at least 10 days prior to submission, allowing ample time for review and feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>


        <strong>Responsibilities</strong>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Formulate innovative scientific inquiries that can be addressed using TA-MOONS observations. </li>
            <li>Provide input to the instrument team, particularly when design compromises are required, ensuring that these do not significantly impact the primary scientific objectives.</li>
            <li>During the commissioning phase, certify whether the instrument meets design goals and verify the feasibility of all consortium proposals. </li>
            <li>Once data becomes available, promptly analyze and publish results for which they are responsible.</li>
            <li>As a consortium, we commit to protecting the research efforts of early career students, postdoctoral researchers, and individuals from historically marginalized communities and underrepresented minorities. </li>

        </ul>
        <br>


        <strong>Observation Plan </strong>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>The allocation of telescope time is solely at the discretion of the DOT Time Allocation Committee (DTAC). Consequently, the science consortium will not engage in proposal evaluations.</li>
            <li>All proposals submitted by the science consortium must be based on the proposals originally submitted upon joining the consortium. To maintain a minimum standard of quality, the consortium will provide feedback and suggestions to the proposal Principal Investigators (PIs), provided that these are shared at least 10 days prior to the DOT proposal deadline. </li>
            <li>Final proposals will be submitted to the DTAC by individual PIs. For transparency and our records concerning time allocated to each science consortium proposal, all submissions will incorporate a common keyword in their titles. </li>
            <li>Once the DTAC has allocated time for each proposal, the science consortium will convene a meeting to consolidate the observation nights and develop the Queue schedule, ensuring that all DTAC-approved targets are included in the same ratio as their associated approved time. </li>
            <li> An experienced project individual will manage the Science Consortium-approved Queue and ensure that observations are conducted in the most effective manner. </li>

        </ul>
        <br>



        <strong>Grievance Address Mechanism</strong>
        <hr>
        <p>The consortium will appoint two ombudspersons who are not collaborators. Any member may approach one or both of these ombudspersons with grievances. The ombudsperson will establish an appropriate subcommittee to evaluate the issue and determine the necessary course of action. All communications with ombudspersons regarding grievances will remain confidential by default, and can only be disclosed with the mutual consent of the involved individual and the ombudsperson, should they deem it necessary. </p>
        <br>



        <strong>Code of Ethics </strong>
        <hr>
        <p>We adhere to the Code of Ethics established by the American Astronomy Society: https://aas.org/policies/ethics#statement </p>
        <br>


        <strong>Instrument Architect Status</strong>
        <hr>
        <p>Individuals in academic careers who have contributed to the development of the TA-MOONS instrument (either hardware or software) and or have operated the instrument for more than 2 FTE will be recognized as instrument architects. (*FTE = Full Time Equivalent)</p>
        <br>



        <strong>Epilogue</strong>
        <hr>
        <p>The TA-MOONS Science Consortium seeks to foster an inclusive and productive environment for astronomical research. By establishing a clear framework for collaboration, expectations, and ethical conduct, we hope to optimize the scientific output of our collective efforts. We invite dedicated researchers to join us in this endeavour to unlock the mysteries of our Universe.</p>
