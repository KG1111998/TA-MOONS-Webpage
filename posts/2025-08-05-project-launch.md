# TA-MOONS Science Consortium Webpage Officially Launched!


We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the TIFR-ARIES Multi-Object Optical to Near-Infrared Spectrograph (TA-MOONS) project science consortium webpage. This marks a significant milestone in our journey to connect with collaborators and contribute to develop a next-generation instrument for the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT).

TA-MOONS is designed For conducting world’s largest YSO spectroscopy survey using the ARIES 3.6m DOT, capable of observing up to 8 celestial objects simultaneously across a wide wavelength range from 0.36 μm to 2.5 μm. 

### Our Core Mission
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Our primary science goal is to conduct an extensive spectroscopic survey of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). This will help us create the world's largest spectral library of YSOs and delve deeper into the physics of protoplanetary discs and star formation.

Currently, there does not exist a multi-object spectrograph which can cover this entire optical to near-infrared wavelength range simultaneously on any telescope in the world. TA-MOONS on the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) will fill this gap with its high survey efficiency for targeted multi-object studies.
